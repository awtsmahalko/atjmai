 - The Alumni Tracking System is an online-based application that aims to enhance the current tracking process of college graduates. It is a web portal that provides a centralized platform for the management of alumni data and facilitates communication between alumni and the institution. The system allows alumni to update their information easily and provides a flexible and automated approach to managing alumni data. The proposed system offers great advantages to the alumni, such as eliminating the need for a group of alumni to manage the alumni forum and reducing maintenance effort. The system provides an all-in-one solution for collecting and managing alumni data, enabling effective communication between alumni and the institution, and offers great flexibility in keeping track of the data. In summary, the Alumni Tracking System is an innovative and useful application that can significantly improve the management of alumni data and benefit both the alumni and the institution.

 - The system aims to integrate the existing unmanaged and outdated alumni data into a well-managed database and act as a portal where alumni can update their information and view online yearbooks. The paper provides insights from the collected alumni responses, including the job positions and employers of alumni, their current location, and the favored choice for further education. The system has been effective in collecting and managing alumni data and has been accessed by many alumni. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of an efficient alumni tracking system and how a web-based platform can make it easier for institutions to manage alumni data.

 - The study aimed to develop a web-based alumni tracking information system at SMKN 1 Garut, test it based on functional aspects, and evaluate user responses. The system was developed using a waterfall model and was tested using blackbox testing and expert validation. The feature completeness matrix was used to calculate the results, and user responses were collected using a Likert scale questionnaire from ten alumni of SMKN 1 Garut. The study found that the web-based alumni tracking information system at SMKN 1 Garut is feasible in terms of functional aspects and received a "very positive" response from users. The study highlights the importance of an efficient alumni tracking system and how a web-based platform can make it easier for institutions to manage alumni data.
